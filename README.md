# HPE-CTY-Project
Predicting cloud storage consumption using time-series analysis

# Abstract
Generally, users of SaaS systems are charged based on the volume of services they consumed
during the billing period. The chargeable services are defined by the SaaS vendor, and it differs in each
system. For example, SaaS systems in storage/backup domains might provide data storage as a
functionality and they may charge their users based on the amount of storage space they consumed.

This project aims at providing certain level of predictability to users of SaaS systems about
their expected billing. Potentially, this could be made feasible by collecting the trend of users’
consumption of SaaS services as a time-series data and running machine learning based prediction
algorithms on such data.

# Development / Runtime environments
